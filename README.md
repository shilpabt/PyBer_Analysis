# Summary
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types are as below,
1. It is recommended to increase the total rides by giving brand awareness and advertisements in urban cities. when the brand is in high demand, gradually PyBer can  increase the fare per ride. In that way average fare per driver will also increase. 
2. It is found that rural cities have higher fare prices and lower driver options than Urban and Suburban cities. These high fare prices per ride may be lower the potential customers and deter new users using PyBer. It is recommended to  increase the number of drivers in rural cities to lower fare prices in these areas.
3. Drivers in Urban areas should moved to suburban and rural areas so that the demands of other city types are also met.
